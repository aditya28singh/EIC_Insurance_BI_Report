# 🚗 EIC Insurance Dashboard

An interactive data visualization project created to analyze and understand the financial struggles of **EIC**, a vehicle insurance company. This report explores **policy trends**, **premium vs claim dynamics**, **customer demographics**, and **vehicle usage insights** over a 5-year period (2014–2018).

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard aims to uncover the root causes behind the economic downturn faced by EIC. Through interactive visuals and aggregated KPIs, stakeholders can quickly grasp how premiums, claims, customer behavior, and vehicle categories have evolved — and where losses may have stemmed from.

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Negative Profitability**: Total claims ($2B) significantly exceed total premiums ($1B) — a **59% claims-to-premium** ratio.
- **High-Risk Segments**:
  - **General Cartage**, **Taxi**, and **Learners** show the most claim volume relative to premiums.
  - Claims are heavily concentrated in certain years (peaking between 2015–2017).
- **Gender Breakdown**:
  - Males account for the majority (63%) of claims and premiums.
- **Vehicle Types**:
  - Motorcycles, trucks, and pickups form the largest policyholder base.
- **Premium vs Claim Imbalance**:
  - Many data points show claims exceeding premiums, suggesting poor risk assessment or underpricing in policies.
